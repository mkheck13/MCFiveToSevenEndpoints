# Mini Challenge Five to Seven - Endpoints

**Description:** Design an API that has four endpoints. Each endpoint has their own Controller file in the Controller folder. Each endpoint has their own Services file in the Service folder. The endpoints are as followed:

1. MadLib: create an endpoint that accepts multiple inputs.  Output should be a story based on those values.

2. OddOrEven: create an endpoint that displays if a number entered is odd or even.

3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then reverses them.

4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and reverses them.  Be sure to display the original characters before the reversed.
